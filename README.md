# Vulnerability Management Operations Project

Hello folks. If you're here, then you watched my Vulnerability Management talk, or need a guide to help you quickly figure out how to document a program and grow it. You'll find the guide as well as some examples here. If you have any suggestions feel free to file an issue or reach out to me at tech+vmo-at-jam-dot-fish.
